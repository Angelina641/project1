                    <p>Leon Sweet started the Sweet Candy Company in Portland, Oregon. The early varieties Leon offered for sale had two distinguishing characteristics: they were made mostly by hand, and people loved them. Customers loved Sweet’s candies back then for the same reason they love them today—quality.</p>

                    <p>Leon moved the operation from Portland, Oregon to Salt Lake City, Utah. Upon relocation, he merged several small specialty stores into one general manufacturing company. Over the years, Sweet’s has become more innovative and more automated, embracing technology to create better and even more delicious products.</p>
